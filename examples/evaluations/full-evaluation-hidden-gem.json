        "reasoning": "Has 7 years experience vs. 5 required. Strong match on Python, PostgreSQL, REST APIs, AWS, Docker. Missing nice-to-haves like Kubernetes and Go, but has equivalent experience with distributed systems through freelance work. Lacks formal CS degree (has Associate's only), but extensive self-directed learning and real-world production experience. Qualification score is 7/10 (strong but not perfect match) due to education gap and missing some nice-to-haves.",

        "score": 9,
        "reasoning": "Very high confidence in ability to perform this role. Portfolio demonstrates genuine depth: built production SaaS serving real customers (50 businesses), handled real money ($3k MRR), dealt with production issues. Open source contributions to Django core show code quality meets professional standards. Technical blog reveals deep understanding of backend concepts (not superficial). Freelance experience means solving diverse problems independently. Only held back from 10 because lacks experience with very large scale (50 customers vs. TechCorp's 500+ enterprise customers processing 10B+ events).",

Explicitly seeking full-time role for 'financial stability' (tired of freelance income volatility) and 'team collaboration' (wants mentorship and to work with others). Sold previous SaaS, suggesting readiness to move on from solo entrepreneurship. Age ~30 (7 years post-Associate's) aligns with settling into career stability. Only concern: entrepreneurial background might mean future startup desire, but current motivation suggests 2-3+ year commitment minimum. Location not mentioned but role is remote so no relocation risk.",

          "Explicit desire for stability after freelance volatility",

Built entire SaaS product solo (frontend, backend, infrastructure, billing) - demonstrates end-to-end ownership and shipping velocity. Sold product successfully, showing business acumen and value creation. Freelance background means juggling multiple priorities, prioritization skills, client communication. Open source contributions indicate giving back to community. If given autonomy and mentorship at TechCorp, could become technical leader and high-leverage contributor. Entrepreneurial mindset + team environment = potential 10x engineer. Only not a 10 because unproven in large company setting.",

Job description values: 'Move fast, iterate quickly' (freelance = shipping fast), 'Data-driven decisions' (built SaaS = understand metrics), 'Ownership and accountability' (solo projects = ultimate ownership), 'Remote-first, async communication' (freelance = remote work experience). Potential concern: used to being own boss, might struggle with taking direction. However, explicitly seeking team collaboration suggests readiness. Open source contributions show ability to work with others' codebases and accept feedback. Score of 8 reflects strong fit with one minor area to validate (authority relationship).",

Started with Associate's degree (not even Bachelor's), taught self Python, built freelance career, created and sold SaaS product, contributed to major open source projects - all in 7 years. Clear pattern of continuous learning: technical blog shows staying current, open source shows engaging with community, freelance diversity shows tackling new problems. Self-directed learning mindset is exactly what's needed in fast-moving startup. Recent completion of distributed systems courses shows proactive skill development. This is someone who will grow into senior/lead/principal roles rapidly. Score of 9 (not 10) because uncertain how trajectory continues in employed setting vs. self-directed freelance.",

      "7_compensation_alignment": {
        "score": 9,
        "reasoning": "Very high likelihood of alignment. Job offers $140k-$180k + equity. Candidate's freelance income was variable but SaaS peaked at $3k MRR ($36k/year) suggesting total income as freelancer was likely $60k-$90k range. Full-time offer of $140k+ represents significant raise AND stability (guaranteed income vs. variable freelance). Equity is likely very appealing given entrepreneurial mindset. No indication candidate is interviewing at FAANG for $300k+ offers. Lack of traditional credentials means fewer competing offers. High likelihood accepts at mid-to-upper range ($160k+) given stability motivation. Only concern: might have inflated expectations from selling SaaS, but that was modest exit.",

Despite lacking Bachelor's degree, has built production systems serving real customers, contributed to major open source projects, and demonstrates continuous learning velocity. Currently seeking stability after freelance career, making this an ideal time to hire. High reward potential given ownership mentality and proven ability to ship. Would likely become technical leader within 12-18 months. Strong culture fit with startup values. Very competitive offer given background.
