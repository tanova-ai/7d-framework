    "summary": "Career changer with exceptional learning velocity and strong teaching background that translates to technical communication skills. Built 6 production-quality projects in 10 months demonstrating solid React fundamentals. Teaching experience provides unique advantage for developer documentation and mentoring. Compensation expectations very reasonable for skill level. Primary concern is limited professional development experience, but rapid growth trajectory and strong motivation mitigate risk.",
    "strengths": [
      "Built portfolio of 6 React applications including e-commerce site with Stripe integration",
      "Teaching background translates to exceptional documentation and communication skills",
      "Steep learning curve: mastered React, TypeScript, and modern frontend tooling in under 1 year",
      "GitHub shows consistent daily commits and clean, well-commented code",
      "Strong problem-solving fundamentals from math teaching background",
      "High motivation and clear career goals (seeking stable tech career)"
    ],
    "concerns": [
      "Only 6 months professional development experience vs 2+ years requirement",
      "Limited exposure to production systems at scale",
      "No experience with team development workflows (code reviews, sprint planning)",
      "May need mentorship on professional software development practices"

    "hidden_gem": {
      "is_hidden_gem": true,
      "reasoning": "Traditional ATS would auto-reject due to '2+ years professional experience' requirement. However, candidate's learning velocity is exceptional—achieved bootcamp graduate competency level in months and already has 6 months junior role experience. Teaching background brings unique cultural value: strong communication, mentorship capability, and patience. Career changers are often highly motivated, loyal, and have realistic compensation expectations. The 'gap' in years is offset by trajectory and transferable skills from teaching."

  "notes": "Classic hidden gem: career changer with high potential. The teaching-to-tech transition often produces excellent developers due to strong communication skills, patience for debugging, and high motivation. Would be filtered out by experience requirement but represents high-value hire with strong loyalty and reasonable comp expectations."
